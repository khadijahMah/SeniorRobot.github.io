  		<li><strong>How does this web app work?</strong>
			After a gesture is made by the user or a voice 
                command is spoken by the user, this web app will 
                recieve the input by way of pre-defined 
			commands. After receiving the command, the 
			spinner will spin to the appropriate command on 
			the wheel representing the users desired 
			instruction to the Rasperry Pi 3 Robot.</li>
			<br></br>
  		<li><strong>What is the purpose of this web app?
			</strong> After a gesture is made by the user or 
                a voice command is spoken by the user, this web 
                app will act as a visual representation of that 
                command.</li>
			<br></br>
  		<li><strong>Who is the User?</strong> The user is 				defined as the person who will interact with the 			gesture and voice device.</li>
			<br></br>
		<li><strong>What is the time interval of publishing a 			command and the web app executing the disired 				action?</strong> The time interval of publishing 			a command and the web app receiving and 					executing the desired action should not exceed 				four seconds.</li>
			<br></br>
		<li><strong>What is the purpose of this 
			project?</strong> The educational industry can 
			take advantage of IoT by implementing this 
			technology into Smart Classroom environments. 
			Therefore, the purpose of this project is to 
			increase the use of IoT Technologies by 
			educators.</li>
			<br></br>
		<li><strong>What is the background of this project?
		    </strong> The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a 				concept by which multiple devices that 					historically have not normally been associated 
			with computers or the Internet can now be 
			outfitted with sensors and other devices that 
			can connect first to a local network, and then 
			to the wider Internet.  These devices have the 
			potential to order new goods based on some 
			threshold of need, such as in the case of a 
			“smart” refrigerator; gather both internal and 
			external climate data such as temperature and 
			humidity, even while housed inside a building; 
			monitor a home for security purposes, and much 
			more.  But IoT devices are not the exclusive 
			domain of the modern home.  They can also be 
			implemented in warehouses, in vehicles, on 
			farmers’ fields, and in classrooms.</li>
			<br></br>
		<li><strong>What is the name of this project?
			</strong> Voice and Motion-based Control System: 
			Proof-ofConcept Implementation on Robotics via 
			Internet-ofThings (IoT) Technologies</li>
			<br></br>

		<li><strong>Quest 9</strong> Answer</li>

		<li><strong>What team is this again?</strong>
